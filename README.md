# Insights-from-Failed-Orders

Gett, previously known as GetTaxi, is an Israeli-developed technology platform solely focused on corporate Ground Transportation Management (GTM). They have an application where clients can order taxis, and drivers can accept their rides (offers). At the moment, when the client clicks the Order button in the application, the matching system searches for the most relevant drivers and offers them the order. In this task, we would like to investigate some matching metrics for orders that did not completed successfully, i.e., the customer didn't end up getting a car.


following steps are used to analye the data
  
    1.Build up distribution of orders according to reasons for failure: cancellations before and after driver assignment, and reasons for order rejection. Analyse the         resulting plot. Which category has the highest number of orders?

    2.Plot the distribution of failed orders by hours. Is there a trend that certain hours have an abnormally high proportion of one category or another? What hours are       the biggest fails? How can this be explained?

    3.Plot the average time to cancellation with and without driver, by the hour. If there are any outliers in the data, it would be better to remove them. Can we draw         any    conclusions from this plot?

    4.Plot the distribution of average ETA by hours. How can this plot be explained?
